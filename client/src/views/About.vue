        I'm Tyler Jones, a software engineer with a background in customer
        service. I became interested in coding as a result of my time working as
        a postal employee and the detail oriented tasks that demanded from me.
        I'm passionate about creating applications that everyone can benefit
        from using and hope to someday be working with a team of likeminded
        individuals.
