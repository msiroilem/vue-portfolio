      About Me
    </h3>
    <p>
      I'm Tyler Jones, a software engineer with a background in customer
      service. I became interested in coding as a result of my time working as a
      postal employee and the detail oriented tasks that demanded from me. I'm
      passionate about creating applications that everyone can benefit from
      using and hope to someday be working with a team of likeminded
      individuals.
